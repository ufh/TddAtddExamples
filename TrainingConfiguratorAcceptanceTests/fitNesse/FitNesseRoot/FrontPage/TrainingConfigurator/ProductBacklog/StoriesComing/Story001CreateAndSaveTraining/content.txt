As a training provider I want to create a new training, so I can design it with modules and topis with their depth and the durations.

Acceptance Criteria:
* the training contains places for modules, topics and the depth they will be taught
* also the duration should be linked to the topics
* there's a possibility to put comments in
* there's a hint, which target group is targeted
* the created training has a version of the format

Constraints:
* only the structure is generated - no content is expected
* a simple excel with the columns module, topic, depth, target group and duration will be enough for now
* titles of the coloums of the file are filled in the first line.
* in a map "version" the version number of the format can be found in cell 1/1
